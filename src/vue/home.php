            <h3> Quick lore : </h3>
            <p>This server takes place in  the Post-Dream Era which has started after the planet has stabilized itself from the bleeding aether that once threatened to split it further than it already has.
                During this bleeding period the overabundance of aether has caused various instabilities most notably disproportionate sizes and dimensional rifts beyond what was previously experienced.
                This explains how gargantuan beings came to be and why foreigners started popping up in Atreia</p>
            <p>
                When the planet had fixed itself, it entered a state of rest which significantly throttled the flow of aether evidenced by the warm core of the abyss had turning cold.
                As a result, aether had become far less available and usable to the point where the societies had abandoned it in search of alternative methods.
                Many existing infrastructures had to be rebuilt from the ground up to implement these new methods and as a result society has visually not changed in the past few centuries.
                The lack of aether has also lead to the stagnation and slow decline of daevas as an ascension hasn't happened since the world slept and Aion's too busy enjoying his retirement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without new daevas the full scale war that both the Elyos and Asmodae waged against eachother has degraded into smaller scale scuffles now that immortality is an asset lost to time.
